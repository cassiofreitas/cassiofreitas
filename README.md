# Things I am learning to be a MarkDown :ninja:

## MarkDown.

It has been a funny task, because I love to learn new things everyday.

I will use this skill to enhance my README.md files and to build my CV at GitHub, using MarkDown.

### How about today `21/02/2022`

Today, I explored [`emoji-cheat-sheet`](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)

A lot of possibilities.

Examples:

- ```:octocat:``` shows :octocat:
- ```:brazil:``` shows :brazil:
- ```:ninja:``` show :ninja:

I am also begining my learning path of [some advanced formatting](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting)

Example I am curious about: [Creating diagrams](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)

```mermaid
graph LR
  A((I a m here)) -- going to --> B{over there}
```
